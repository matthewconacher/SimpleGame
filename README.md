## A Simple Game Using Pygame

This is a very simple side scrolling game that uses collision detection. 

Arrow keys can be used to move the player object up/down, left or right.

The player must avoid colliding with the enemies to win.

The player can win immediately by colliding with the prize object which is always in a random position.

## How to Run

Please ensure you have pygame installed before running:

https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

You can replace the images with any that you see fit as long as they are the same sizes, otherwise the collision detection will not be accurate.

Run using Python3.
